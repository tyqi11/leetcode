# LeetCodeExplanation

This repository shows how I think of the solutions to problems on LeetCode and how I want to explain them to the others(including interviewers). 

All the solutions are in Java.

## Must-Masters

Fundamental problems, whose solutions can be part of a bigger problem. You need to come up with the best and final result in one try in an interview.

## Tiny-Tips

### Binary Search 

Thanks @Poojan for teaching me this.

* `T T T T T F F F `

```java
while (true) {
    if (left > right) {
        ans = right;
        break;
    }
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (checker()) {
        left = mid + 1;
    } else {
        right = mid - 1;
    }
}
return ans;
```

* `F F F F F T T T`

```java
while (true) {
	if (left > right) {
        ans = left;
        break;
    }
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (checker()) {
        right = mid - 1;
    } else {
        left = mid + 1;
    }
}
return ans;
```



### Bit manipulation

### Graph and Tree

## Templates

* [Union-Find]([template]Union-Find.java), shown as an answer to Problem 547. Friend Circles

* [Topological Sort]([template][template]Topological-Sort)

## Regex

`str.split("\\.")`

a dot ('.') in regex means "any character". If you mean a dot, you need a backslash

to escape it. And it takes double backslash to create a single backslash in regex.
